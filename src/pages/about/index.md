Hello, my name is Song Wang.

I am a grad student majored in Computer Science, living in ~~Beijing~~, ~~Chengdu~~, New York.

I code Javascript for web, analyse data with Python.

I love open source, and I contributed over [2,000
times](https://github.com/wangsongiam) last year on Github.

I play with [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/wangsup/), [code wars](https://www.codewars.com/users/wangsup) for new languages and
algorithms.

I configure and sync the [dotfile](https://github.com/wangsongiam/dotfiles) for my editors, terminals, apps, macros.

I am a fast typer ranked top 6% of the world with [2,500 matches](https://www.keyhero.com/profile/).

## About songwang.io
This site is my blog site, primarily for sharing my ideas and works. It is the 4th version, and its predecessor was built in 2016 with Jekyll. Yet, thanks to the help from Gatsby and the React ecosystem, this version is even faster in a more progressive way and performs pretty well in the browser.

I started building this site back in June 2017, when Gatsby was in the alpha versions of 1.0, and Netlify-CMS was on the road to version 1. They were pretty buggy, but I still gave them a shot.

### Tech Stack
* Gatsby.js (extends Webpack)
* React.js
* GraphQL, Relay
* Styled components
* Netlify-CMS

### Development
Although I experienced with React and Webpack before, It was a frustrating ordeal to work with the alpha version to me. I was frequently asking, reporting and fixing the problem as long as I can those days, yet still, failed uncountable times, sometimes couldn't figure how to make things work for days. But thanks to the community from both React and Gatsby, I was able to make my site work in my preferred way before the Beta version was released. It took over three weeks which is way more than I thought at the beginning, but it was a valuable learning experience, and I am happy with both my site and my contribution to the communities.

### Design

Two things I care the most on this site are simplicity and performance. 

For simplicity, I designed with only two colors, one as the main color for all the words, one for hovering color; I kept things as simple and straightforward as possible; Also, each UI element and Styling block are modular and composed by Javascript, could also be reused if necessary.

For performance, I avoid using any animation or transitions, no drawing and keyframes make loading easy and fast.
